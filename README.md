## Introduction
This project provides the continuation/GMRES method (C/GMRES method) based solvers for nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) and an automatic code generator for NMPC, called `AutoGenU`.

The following C/GMRES based solvers are provided: 
- `MultipleShootingCGMRESSolver` : The multiple shooting based C/GMRES method with condensing of the state and costate directions.
- `SingleShootingCGMRESSolver` : The original C/GMRES method (single shooting).

## Requirement
- C++17 (MinGW or MSYS and PATH to either are required for Windows users)
- CMake, git
- Python 3.8 or later, Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook, SymPy, NumPy, and collection (to generate `ocp.hpp`, `main.cpp`, and `CMakeLists.txt` by `AutoGenU.ipynb`)
- Matplotlib, seaborn (to plot simulation data on `AutoGenU.ipynb`)
- ffmpeg (to generate animations in the example notebooks)
- Doxygen (optional, to generate C++ docs)


## Usage
### 1. Setup requirements
Please confirm that you clone this repository as 
```
git clone https://github.com/ohtsukalab/QuadrotorFTC_Benchmark --recursive
```
Otherwise, please do the following command:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
The python modules can be installed via
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Code generation
`AutoGenU.ipynb` generates the following source files under your setting state equation, constraints, cost function, and parameters: 
- `ocp.hpp` : A definition of the optimal control problem (OCP).
- `main.cpp` : An executablb of the closed-loop simulation.
- `CMakeLists.txt` : Scripts to build C++ projects. 
- Files in `python` directory : Source files of Python interface via pybind11.

You can generate these files, run simulations, plot results, and install the Python interfaces through `AutoGenU.ipynb`.


### 3. Python bindings
Python bindings are installed via `.ipynb` files. 
To use the installed Python bindings, set `PYTHONPATH` as 
```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$DESTINATION/lib/python3.x/site-packages
``` 
Then you can use python interfaces as 
```
import cgmres.common # this includes horizon, solver settings, etc.
import cgmres.your_ocp_name # this includes OCP definition and NMPC solvers 
```


### 4. Install header-only `cgmres` C++ library
Aside from the notebook for the code-generation, the C++ `cgmres` library, which is a header-only library, can be installed by running
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=YOUR_INSTALL_DESTINATION
make install 
```
at the project root directory of `autogenu-jupyter`.  
Then you can build the NMPC code with the generated `ocp.hpp` file and without `.ipynb` notebook files.   
The examples are found in `examples/cpp` directory.  


### 5. Install `autogenu` Python module
The pythton module `autogenu` can be instatlled by running
```
python3 -m pip install setuptools
python3 -m pip install .
```
at the project root directory of `autogenu-jupyter`.
Further, if you install have installed header-only `cgmres` C++ library as step 4, then you can run `.ipynb` files for the code generation in everywhere.


### Documentation
C++ API documentation of `cgmres` library is found at https://ohtsukalab.github.io/autogenu-jupyter/.   
Python interfaces are almost the same as the C++ API, so please refere to https://ohtsukalab.github.io/autogenu-jupyter/ even for Python interfaces as well as the [tips for conversions between C++ and Python](https://ohtsukalab.github.io/autogenu-jupyter/md__github_workspace_examples_python__r_e_a_d_m_e.html).


## Demos
Demos are presented in `cartpole.ipynb`, `pendubot.ipynb`, `hexacopter.ipynb`, and `mobilerobot.ipynb`. You can obtain the following simulation results jusy by runnig these `.ipynb` files. The details of the each OCP formulations are described in each `.ipynb` files.
